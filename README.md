Thermodynamics with Complications

A pocket dictionary for students and unstudents

With bonus illustrations about Susskind’s Cat.

These notes are meant as a refresher on classical thermodynamics, but we also re-interpret the
usual variables in terms of computational complexity and uncomplexity in the context of ideas
from Susskind and others.

We explore two “dictionaries”: one that identifies complexity with interior volume (the
standard Susskind picture), and another that treats uncomplexity as the volume-like variable,
highlighting its role as a resource similar to free energy.

We see how familiar thermodynamic tools — Maxwell relations, heat capacities, and equations
of state — look when translated into these languages.

All work done is basically renaming of variables in classical thermo plus spelling out the
interpretations. 

We also include an exposition of a “graded second law” in spirit of Munson et
al, 2025.
