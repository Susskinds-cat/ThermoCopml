Thermodynamics with Complications

A pocket dictionary for students and unstudents

With bonus illustrations about Susskind’s Cat.

These notes are meant as a refresher on classical thermodynamics, but we also re-interpret the
usual variables in terms of computational complexity and uncomplexity in the context of ideas
from Susskind and others.

We explore a “dictionary” that maps thermodynamic quantities to their complexity analogues.

We see how familiar thermodynamic tools — Maxwell relations, heat capacities, and equations
of state — look when translated into these languages.

All work done is basically renaming variables in classical thermo plus spelling out the
interpretations. 

This is not a direct study of black holes. We are using a simplified model of a black hole
(developed by researchers working in quantum field theory, general relativity, and quantum gravity) as a teaching
tool. Our goal is not to analyze real black holes, but to show how thermodynamics provides a framework for
understanding the ideas behind these models.
